# ESP32 WiFi Sensor Project

This project uses an ESP32 to collect temperature, pressure, humidity, and light data and send it via UDP over Wi-Fi to a Python script that visualises the results in real time. 

## Components
- ESP32 Dev Module
Soon to be added(currently randomly generating data):
- BME280 (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure)
- BH1750 (Light Level)
